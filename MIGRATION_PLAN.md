# üì± MOAI Native - Web to Mobile Migration Plan

## üéØ Migration Overview
**Current Status**: ~98% Complete  
**Target**: Feature parity with web app + mobile-specific enhancements  
**State Management**: XState v5 + React Query  
**Database**: Use existing Supabase tables (no new table creation)  
**Last Updated**: 2025-08-04

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Strategy

### State Management Approach
- **XState v5**: Complex UI flows, multi-step processes, side effects
  - ‚úÖ Workout builder flow (fully implemented)
  - ‚úÖ Exercise configuration state machine
  - Onboarding flow (future)
  - Chat state management (enhanced)
  - Coach platform workflows (future)
- **React Query**: Server state, caching, synchronization
  - ‚úÖ API data fetching with proper typing
  - ‚úÖ Optimistic updates for real-time features
  - ‚úÖ Background refetching and error handling
- **React State**: Simple UI state
  - ‚úÖ Form inputs and validation
  - ‚úÖ Modal visibility and UI toggles
  - ‚úÖ Component-level state management

### Database Strategy
**‚ö†Ô∏è Important**: Use existing Supabase tables only. Do NOT create new tables.
- ‚úÖ **Existing Tables**: `exercises`, `workout_templates`, `profiles`, `messages`, etc.
- ‚úÖ **Extensions**: Add fields via `exercise_library_extended` where needed
- ‚úÖ **Migration Tables**: Only `message_reactions` and `message_read_receipts` were added during chat enhancement

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation Guidelines

### XState Usage Patterns

1. **Multi-Step Forms**
   ```typescript
   // Example: Onboarding flow
   const onboardingMachine = createMachine({
     id: 'onboarding',
     initial: 'personalInfo',
     context: {
       userData: {},
       currentStep: 0
     },
     states: {
       personalInfo: {
         on: { NEXT: 'fitnessGoals' }
       },
       fitnessGoals: {
         on: { 
           NEXT: 'preferences',
           BACK: 'personalInfo'
         }
       },
       preferences: {
         on: {
           SUBMIT: 'submitting',
           BACK: 'fitnessGoals'
         }
       },
       submitting: {
         invoke: {
           src: 'submitOnboarding',
           onDone: 'complete',
           onError: 'error'
         }
       }
     }
   });
   ```

2. **Complex UI States**
   ```typescript
   // Example: Chat interface
   const chatMachine = createMachine({
     id: 'chat',
     type: 'parallel',
     states: {
       connection: {
         initial: 'connecting',
         states: {
           connecting: {},
           connected: {},
           disconnected: {},
           error: {}
         }
       },
       messaging: {
         initial: 'idle',
         states: {
           idle: {},
           typing: {},
           sending: {},
           uploading: {}
         }
       }
     }
   });
   ```

### React Query Patterns

1. **Data Fetching with Caching**
   ```typescript
   export const useWorkouts = () => {
     return useQuery({
       queryKey: ['workouts'],
       queryFn: WorkoutService.fetchUserWorkouts,
       staleTime: 5 * 60 * 1000, // 5 minutes
       cacheTime: 10 * 60 * 1000, // 10 minutes
     });
   };
   ```

2. **Optimistic Updates**
   ```typescript
   export const useCreateWorkout = () => {
     const queryClient = useQueryClient();
     
     return useMutation({
       mutationFn: WorkoutService.createWorkout,
       onMutate: async (newWorkout) => {
         await queryClient.cancelQueries(['workouts']);
         const previousWorkouts = queryClient.getQueryData(['workouts']);
         queryClient.setQueryData(['workouts'], old => [...old, newWorkout]);
         return { previousWorkouts };
       },
       onError: (err, newWorkout, context) => {
         queryClient.setQueryData(['workouts'], context.previousWorkouts);
       },
       onSettled: () => {
         queryClient.invalidateQueries(['workouts']);
       }
     });
   };
   ```

## üìÖ Timeline Estimates

- **Phase 1**: 4-6 weeks
- **Phase 2**: 6-8 weeks  
- **Phase 3**: 3-4 weeks
- **Phase 4**: 4-6 weeks
- **Phase 5**: 4-5 weeks
- **Phase 6**: 3-4 weeks

**Total Estimated Timeline**: 24-33 weeks for full feature parity

## üéØ Next Steps

1. **Immediate Priority**: Complete Phase 1.1 (Enhanced Chat)
2. **Set up XState machines** for complex flows
3. **Implement missing services** following established patterns
4. **Add comprehensive error handling**
5. **Set up proper testing infrastructure**

## üìù Notes

- All new features should follow the established service layer pattern
- Use XState for complex, stateful workflows
- Use React Query for all server state management
- Maintain consistency with existing UI components
- Prioritize mobile UX over direct web port
- Consider performance implications for all features
